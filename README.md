# Character Achievements

Character Achievements is an addon that modifies the display of achievements in order to easily distinguish those earned by your current character and those earned by another character on your account. A check button is added to the Achievement Frame that allows for quick and easy switching between the styles and updates your achievement points accordingly.

## Character Style

The display is broken down into 3 parts:

* Character Achievements - default display of completed achievements (red title background/border)
* Account earned Achievements - blue bordered display with slight coloration and lighting.
* Not Completed Achievements - default display of incomplete achievement.

## Account-earned Style

The default display is used except:

* account-earned achievements have a blue border instead of red.

## Note

* Character points for toons that are not in a guild requires a work-around due to limitations set by Blizzard. It will force an inspect with self once on each login and when an achievement is earned in order to determine the correct points.
* Account-earned achievements are considered those that have been earned by any character on your account (except your current character). It is different than Blizzard's Account-wide achievements; achievements that have a shared progress across all characters. These are the ones that have the blue title background and border.
